        <h1>What Is Parallax Design?</h1>
        <p>The term “parallax” first came from the visual effect of 2D side scrolling videogames that used different background image movement speeds to create the illusion of depth during gameplay.
                <br />
                 This was generally done by making the background of the game move slower than the foreground in order to make it seem further away. 
                <br />
                This same concept applies to parallax site design in which the background of the website moves at a different speed as the rest of the page for an impressive visual effect that allows for countless creative applications for online storytelling.</p>
